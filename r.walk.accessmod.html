<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.walk</em> computes anisotropic cumulative cost of moving between
different geographic locations on an input elevation raster map whose
cell category values represent elevation combined with an input raster
map layer whose cell values represent friction cost.

<p>
<em>r.walk</em> outputs 1) a raster map showing the lowest
cumulative cost of moving between each cell and the user-specified
starting points and 2) a second raster map showing the movement 
direction to the next cell on the path back to the start point (see 
<a href="#move">Movement Direction</a>). It uses an input elevation 
raster map whose cell category values represent elevation, 
combined with a second input raster map whose cell values 
represent friction costs.

<p>
This function is similar to <em><a href="r.cost.html">r.cost</a></em>,
but in addiction to a friction map, it considers an anisotropic travel
time due to the different walking speed associated with downhill and
uphill movements.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
The formula from Aitken 1977/Langmuir 1984 (based on Naismith's rule
for walking times) has been used to estimate the cost parameters of
specific slope intervals:

<div class="code"><pre>
T= [(a)*(Delta S)] + [(b)*(Delta H uphill)] + [(c)*(Delta H moderate downhill)] + [(d)*(Delta H steep downhill)]
</pre></div>

where:
<ul>
  <li><tt>T</tt> is time of movement in seconds,</li>
  <li><tt>Delta S</tt> is the distance covered in meters,</li>
  <li><tt>Delta H</tt> is the altitude difference in meter.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The a, b, c, d <b>walk_coeff</b> parameters take in account
movement speed in the different conditions and are linked to:

<ul>
  <li>a: underfoot condition (a=1/walking_speed)</li>
  <li>b: underfoot condition and cost associated to movement uphill</li>
  <li>c: underfoot condition and cost associated to movement moderate downhill</li>
  <li>d: underfoot condition and cost associated to movement steep downhill</li>
</ul>

It has been proved that moving downhill is favourable up to a specific
slope value threshold, after that it becomes unfavourable. The default
slope value threshold (<b>slope_factor</b>) is -0.2125, corresponding
to tan(-12), calibrated on human behaviour (&gt;5 and &lt;12 degrees:
moderate downhill; &gt;12 degrees: steep downhill). The default values
for a, b, c, d <b>walk_coeff</b> parameters are those proposed by
Langmuir (0.72, 6.0, 1.9998, -1.9998), based on man walking effort in
standard conditions.

<p>The <b>lambda</b> parameter of the linear equation
combining movement and friction costs:<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
total cost = movement time cost + (lambda) * friction costs
</pre></div>
must be set in the option section of <em>r.walk</em>.
<p>
For a more accurate result, the "knight's move" option can be used
(although it is more time consuming). In the diagram below, the center
location (O) represents a grid cell from which cumulative distances
are calculated. Those neighbours marked with an x are always
considered for cumulative cost updates. With the "knight's move"
option, the neighbours marked with a K are also considered.

<div class="code"><pre>
  K   K 
K x x x K
  x O x
K x x x K
  K   K
</pre></div>

<p>The minimum cumulative costs are computed using Dijkstra's
algorithm, that find an optimum solution (for more details see
<em>r.cost</em>, that uses the same algorithm).

<a name="move"></a>
<h2>Movement Direction</h2>
<p>The movement direction surface is created to record the sequence of
movements that created the cost accumulation surface. Without it 
<em><a href="r.drain.html">r.drain</a></em> would not correctly create a path from an end point 
back to the start point. The direction of each cell points towards 
the next cell. The directions are recorded as degrees CCW from East:
<div class="code"><pre>
       112.5      67.5         i.e. a cell with the value 135 
157.5  135   90   45   22.5    means the next cell is to the north-west
       180   x   360           
202.5  225  270  315  337.5
       247.5     292.5
</pre></div>

<p>
Once <em>r.walk</em> computes the cumulative cost map as a linear
combination of friction cost (from friction map) and the altitude and
distance covered (from the digital elevation
model), <em><a href="r.drain.html">r.drain</a></em> can be used to
find the minimum cost path. Make sure to use the <b>-d</b> flag and
the movement direction raster map when
running <em><a href="r.drain.html">r.drain</a></em> to ensure the path
is computed according to the proper movement directions.
